# Clock-Shader-for-Meta-Spark

This project is an example to show how clock shaders work in Meta Spark or SparkSL 

Since iDate has no equivalent in SparkSL, first we have to write a java script code to get the time and convert the current time to seconds, then pass that number into the shader as a uniform

This method does not work with all the shadertoy shaders but it probably works fine with most of them
